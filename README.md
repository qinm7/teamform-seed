## The introductino to team-forming, the single-webpage application

## Server is needed to execute the single-webpage app

## Recommendation Algorithm 2.0
 1. distribute points based on tag being idenical, in the same subcategory or in the same category.
 2. track tags of pages visited in a key: tag, value: nbrVisits array.
 3. caculating the matching scores between users and events(and teams): 
       using tags from users (both tags input by user and tags accumulated by page visits with more than 5 hits) and events
       caculating similarities between two tags using the similarity points
       order by most points not showing zero point matches.

## Testing

### Running Unit Tests

 We provide a Karma configuration file to run them.

* the configuration is found at `karma.conf.js`
* all unit test cases should be written inside the folder `app/unit_tests`

The easiest way to run the unit tests is to use the supplied npm script:

```
npm test
```

This script will start the Karma test runner to execute the unit tests. 
In this course, we will mainly focus on the branch and statement coverage. 
The output files will be stored inside the `app/coverage` folder. 

## Addtional information for COMP3111H students

Besides from web development, COMP3111H team needs to work on a mobile app (iOS and Android). We recommend your team to use Ionic framework [http://ionicframework.com/] (http://ionicframework.com/). Ionic framework is based on AngularJS. Features completed in Angular can be easily ported to Ionic.
